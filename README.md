# Client-Server-Communication-Using-Python

This implementation simulates the client server communication using python. Sockets have been used to send data each other. Apart from that the server can handle evrypted text file as well as dictionary when sending messages. The program also prompts the server to choose whether to print the recieved message on the console or save it in a file. The code has been written according to the PEP Standards and exception handling has been inculcated as well. Unit test for each code file are also included.


# Task requirements
- Build a simple client/server network
- Create a dictionary, populate it, serialize it and send it to a server
- Create a text file and send it to a server
- With the dictionary, the user should be able to set the pickling format to one of the following: binary, JSON and XML
- The user will need to have the option to encrypt the text in a text file
- The server should have a configurable option to print the contents of the sent items to the screen and or to a file
- The server will need to be able to handle encrypted contents
- The client and server can be on separate machines or on the same machine.
- Make sure that the code is written to PEP standard and uses exception handling to handle potential errors
